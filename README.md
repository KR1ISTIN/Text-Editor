# Text-Editor
This project is a text-editor written as a PWA

## Description
Text-Editor is written as a PWA and was completed to enhance my knowledge on how a PWA works. This project allowed me to implement PUT and READ methods working with IndexDB, caching data, and webpack. Therefore, this project is able to function offline and store data.
